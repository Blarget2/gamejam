Subject survived the surgical procedure and the organism seems to have accepted the synthetic heart. The subject refused the procedure briefly before the operation but due to financial reasons and contract obligations, he was narcotized and brought to the operating room. No physiological reactions to the synthetic heart. However, strange changes on the synaptic scan have been observed. Subjects appears to have increased brain activity and neurological mutations. The sense of hearing was improved and the nerves became more sensitive. New potential nominee for Project X.
