The DNA of patient 187 and Cloe aren't compatible... everything i hoped and what I lived for is done. My life'swork is done. All my patients and employees got ill one by one. Heard nothing about the patient who gave me the only reason to live... I wish i could thank him for the time of hope I spent with my sister. Good-bye cruel world
