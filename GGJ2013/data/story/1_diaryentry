Withdrew my license...? Not with me! I can't believe it! The scientific findings I could give mankind about efficiency boosters. Sometimes there must be a risk to change the world.  I've been working on this project for years. These stupid, incompetent fools. Today we were nearly full and we had to recruit surgeons from other hospitals so we could handle all those patients. Scores of stupid folks will come to us and by such a brilliant project they will soon see that I'm the only one who's right for this job. For the science, for the progress.
