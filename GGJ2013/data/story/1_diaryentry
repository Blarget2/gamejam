Withdrew my license...? Not with me! I can't believe it! The scientific findings I could give mankind about efficiency boosters. Sometimes there must be a risk to change the world.  I've been working on this project for years. These stupid, incompetent fools. Today we were nearly full and we had to recruit surgeons from other hospitals so we could handle all those patients. Scores of stupid folks will come to us and by such a brilliant project they will soon see that I'm the only one who's right for this job. For the science, for the progress.

Withdrew my license...? Not with me! I can't believe it! My scientific findings about efficiency boosters are of paramount importance. In science, risks have to be accepted in order to be able to change the world. I've been working on this project for years. Those deficient, short-sighted fools. Today, we were nearly at full capacity so we had to recruit surgeons from other hospitals in order to handle all those patients. They will soon recognize the sheer brilliance of this project and when they do, they will realize that I'm the only person for the job. For science, for progress.
