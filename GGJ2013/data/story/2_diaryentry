Of course they couldn't  deny my genius. The Energy we can generate from a product like healthy heart that pushes for 70 years or more with such low costs is incredible. The different reactions to the remove of the heart are so very manifold. We nearly can't record all the various behaviors of the human body. Science wasn't so exciting since collegetime.  Well we still got a lot of paranoia, hallucination and psychotic impulses and numbers of cases with physical and mental boost are going down. By the way one of my colleagues called me insane yesterday... insane? me?! Just because i'm doing my work and don't hesitate to risk something they call me insane. After that i put him on the list for the heart-removementproject. We still just got a few number of possible products for the x-project. Without the x-project the whole programm is meaningless. I'll have to get new prospects ... and I'll better hurry.
