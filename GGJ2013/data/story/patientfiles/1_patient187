Testperson survived the surgical procedure succesful and accepted the synthetic heart. The testperson refused the procedure brief before the operation but because financial reasons und the sign of the patient, he was narcotized and brought to the operation. Not one physic reaction  to the synthetic heart but there are strange changes by the synapsisscan. The brainfunction grows. The hearing got boosted and the nerves got more sensitive. New potential nominee for the x-project.
