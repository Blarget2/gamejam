Subject survived the surgical procedure successfully and accepted the synthetic heart. The subject refused the procedure briefly before the operation but due to financial reasons and contract obligations, he was narcotized and brought to the operating room. Not one physic reaction to the synthetic heart but there are strange changes by the synaptic scan. The brain function grows. The sense of hearing got boosted and the nerves got more sensitive. New potential nominee for Project X.
