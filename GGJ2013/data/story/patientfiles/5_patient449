Patient No. 0449
Age: 30
Gender: male
Constitution: good

Subject 0449 was a quite resisting patient. Two attempts at flight were recorded. We were able to daze him so we can harvest the product. I'm afraid we have to keep the product here even if the health condition would explain a Level-C disqualification from the project.
