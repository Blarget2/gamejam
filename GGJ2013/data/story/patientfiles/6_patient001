My first try to create a meta-human, is my own younger sister Cloe. Born with a heartdefect,  she were struggling for life since she were a chield. I spent days without break and nights without sleep to find an answer that might help. In the last month her constitution got more worse step by step bit by bit.... Today she died and I were'nt able to help her. Everything I learned was useless and everything I tried didn't work out. But I invented a method to let the Heart help to survive. The x-project had a function in the end.
