The subject survived the surgical procedure. The transplant was rejected by the new host body. We are too busy these days. This patient is just one of many we have to care for. After the treating he got nervous and resisted the nurses. We hat to calm him with painkillers. After that he started to halluciniate and talked about a dumb knocking.
