The subject survived the surgical procedure but it didn't accepted the heart so well. We are so crowded these days.This patient is just one of many we have to care for. After the treating he got nervous and resisted the nurses. We hat to calm him with painkillers. After that he started to halluciniate and talked about a dumb knocking.
