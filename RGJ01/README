=== Description ===
Survive as long as possible.
You can't take many hits from the asteroids!
Use the mouse.

=== Compile ===
Dependencies you'll need for compiling: 
SFML 1.6, Boost > 1.38, C++ compiler, Box2D > 2.1.0

IF you have those, just issue "make" and stuff should compile.
Then run ./AsteroidJam.bin

=== Thanks And Resources ===
Thanks go out to the authors of the libs I use as well as the tools used.
Specificially Inkscape and sfxr.

I use music from the Hamster Alliance (http://www.hamsteralliance.com).
